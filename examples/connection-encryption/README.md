We call this usage a *connection upgrade* where given a connection between peer A to peer B, a protocol handshake can be performed that gives that connection new properties.

A byproduct of having these encrypted communications modules is that we can authenticate the peers we are dialing to. You might have noticed that every time we dial to a peer in libp2p space, we always use its PeerId at the end (e.g /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/89765/p2p/QmWCbVw1XZ8hiYBwwshPce2yaTDYTqTaP7GCHGpry3ykWb), this PeerId is generated by hashing the Public Key of the peer. With this, we can create a crypto challenge when dialing to another peer and prove that peer is the owner of a PrivateKey that matches the Public Key we know.

## Set up encrypted communications

We will build this example on top of example for [Protocol and Stream Multiplexing](../protocol-and-stream-multiplexing). You will need the `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` module to complete it, go ahead and `npm install @chainsafe/libp2p-noise`.

To add them to your libp2p configuration, all you have to do is:

```JavaScript
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { tcp } from '@libp2p/tcp'
import { mplex } from '@libp2p/mplex'
import { yamux } from '@chainsafe/libp2p-yamux',
import { noise } from '@chainsafe/libp2p-noise'

const createNode = async () => {
  return await createLibp2p({
    transports: [ tcp() ],
    streamMuxers: [ mplex(), yamux() ],
    // Attach noise as the crypto channel to use
    conectionEncrypters: [ noise() ]
  })
}
```

And that's it, from now on, all your libp2p communications are encrypted. Try running the example [1.js](./1.js) to see it working.
